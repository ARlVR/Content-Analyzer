# Content Analyzer App

With this app you can audit a Youtube channel to see if you'd like to sponsor them or just analyze the type of content they have. All you have to do is to pass a list of links to the videos of this channel and you will get a list of thumbnails. Once you select a video by clicking its thumbnail, you can view:
1. a summary of the video,
2. the topics that are discussed in the video,
3. whether there are any sensitive topics discussed in the video.
